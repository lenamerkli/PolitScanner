# PolitScanner

## Abstract

Swiss politicians lie.
And they mostly get away with it.
"One reason for this is that fact-checks, which can only be carried out retrospectively, are surprisingly ineffective. Listeners still remember the false information. The correction is forgotten." â€” Philipp Gerlach.
This technical report provides a comprehensive overview of the artificial intelligence components of the PolitScanner project.
It aims to automatically detect false narratives and fake news in the speeches of Swiss politicians while avoiding the inaccuracies inherent in Large Language Models.

The training code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/lenamerkli/PolitScanner).
