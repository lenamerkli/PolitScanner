The goal of this project is to split a string of sentences into sentences.
This is the current python code you are going to work with:
```python
{PROGRAM}
```
Here is the error it produced on the unittest:
```
{ERROR}
```
This happened with the string ```{STRING}```
It should have split the string into these sentences: ```{SENTENCES}```
But it returned these sentences: ```{SENTENCES_AI}```
Your job is to modify the code in a way that the unittest passes. Return the entire code between two pairs of triple backticks.
